    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p><strong style="color:#00ff99;">MySimpleEssential</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. While most of our apps store all data locally on your device, some applications may use a database to store non-personal, app-specific information necessary for their functionality. We do not collect, store, or share personally identifiable information.</p>
    
    <h2>AI Models and Data Processing</h2>
    <p>Our applications may use on-device AI models or third-party AI services to provide their functionality. When third-party AI services are used, we only send the necessary data for processing and do not include any personal information. We do not use your data to train our AI models or third-party models.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. You are in complete control of your data, which is stored on your device or in a secure, anonymous database.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We may use third-party services for AI processing, as mentioned above. We do not integrate with any other third-party services that would have access to your data.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
